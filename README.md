Animated text for your next Power Apps project!

Very simple component you can import into your app in seconds!

The component has a couple of very simple properties:

◻ Text1, Text2, and Text3 - these are texts that will appear in the carousel

◼ GradientHEX1 and GradientHEX2 - these are for Text1 which is gradient text

◻ Text2Colour - colour of Text2

◼ Text3Colour - colour of Text3

If you want to use the text on your landing page, don't forget to add a timer control and then use the Navigate() function in the OnTimerEnd property to navigate to your screen of choice. The length of this animation is approx 10 seconds but feel free to go to the source SVG code and update it as you wish :)

Any feature suggestions are very welcome :)
